# Hello, since you found this file, let me explain a few things:
#
# When Ansible's systemd module fails, it's hard to find output (Thank you, Ansible!).
#
# For example, Ansible will be extra cheeky and tell you to check `systemctl status unit`
# and `journal -xe`, but what gives.
#
# You need to do it yourself, which means: log into the server.
#
# But what if you can, or you're not supposed to. Or you're getting the failure in CI?
#
# Apparently no one ever thought of that! Which begs the question, is anyone using Ansible
# in production? (Don't answer.) And whatever you end up doing, you have to spend even more
# time.
#
# So yeah, here we go â€” attempting to fix this a little (with even more YAML):
#
# We can include this file using include_tasks from the handler file. (Yes, that is possible)
#
# And here we run our usual commands, to get output and debug like there is no tomorrow.
#
# This also opens up the possibility to run a bunch of commands on notify, not just one, or
# to build an obscure chain of handlers. Yay!
